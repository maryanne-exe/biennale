Here is Xcode storyboard of the app you saw in my portfolio. Itâ€™s a prototype created 2 years ago so here are the ways how I would improve it:

- On Main menu screen replace Buttons with Table view. It will make layout easier to extend if there is a need to add a new section;
- On Main menu screen replace images with backgrounds and labels. It will make the app more accessible;
- Labels on all screens are with dynamic text. It will make captions easier to update in cases like localization compared with hardcoded text;
- Add remaining screens so all links are clickable.
